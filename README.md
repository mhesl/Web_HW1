for the first part of question 3 we should use git commit -- amend and for the second part we should use git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_file" HEAD
for the third part we can use git diff and put it in .patch file and send the .patch file to your friend.
